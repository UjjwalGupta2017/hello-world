connecting hive developer to hive running in linux

Steps for cloudera distribution:
1.u should have hadoop & hive installed on linux(in virtual machine)(which comes with cloudera itself)
2.type  sudo yum install hive-jdbc   to install hive-jdbc drivers
3. set  class path for usr/lib/hive/lib/*.jar and usr/lib/hadoop/lib/*.jar
4.start hive thrift serve by typing     hive --service hiveserver &
5. open hive developer software in windows environment and create connection by

name: Hive_conn
driver:org.apache.hadoop.hive.jdbc.HiveDriver
URL:jdbc:hive://192.168.71.129:10000/default

the ip address given above is of the linux machine on which hive is running.
in case that doesnot works then try to set the class path for java as well.

in linux we have 99% of the softwares in the repository there we just need to type "apt-get install software_name".\

in linux environment whether server or desktop once u made changes in the configuration files of any service or software then u need 
to put it to restart in order to make that service run according to new configurations.

in linux server environment, lets say webserver which consists of a whole lot of services like apache service, Mysql, Php etc...if 
u stop any service then the server doesnot stops.

to start/stop/restart any service type "sudo /etc/int.d/service_name start" u can replace start with stop or restart. 

in linux we can see the task manager by typing "top" command.In order to kill any process just press "k", then type the process id.
in order to explore the top command just type "h" instead of "k"
